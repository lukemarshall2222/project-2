# UOCIS322 - Project 2  Luke Marshall

This project is meant as an introduction to Docker and Flask. The Docker portion the project is meant to familiarize us with the usage of Docker to build and run containers, such as the Flask server. The Flask server portion of the project is meant to introduce the framework and how to use it to make building and running a Python server much easier than from scratch.
